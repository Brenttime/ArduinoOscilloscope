<h2>Arduino Oscilloscope Project </h2>
The intention of this project was to build a desktop osciliscope using an Arduino UNO. After looking at many different projects regarding this idea, I was able to develop my own, but with a python UI. I started this project in order to get a good grasp on electerical engineering concepts, and also get a better understanding of programming in Python.

<h2>Useful Key Shortcuts</h2>
If you want to change scale in the GUI you need to use the right and left arrow keys:
<ul>
  <li>Left Arrow Key - reduce scale</li>
  <li>Right Arrow Key - increase scale</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python 3+</li>
  <li>Pip3</li>
  <li>Keyboard</li>
  <li>Serial</li>

</ul>

<h4>Notes</h4>
